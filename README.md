# Automated fact checking
In this work we focus on assesing the veracity of claims which is different from related tasks such as fake news detection [[1]](#1). The automated
fact-checking is consisted of three stages as outlined by [[1]](#2): 

(i) claim detection to identify claims that require verification

(ii) evidence retrieval to find sources supporting or refuting the claim

(iii) claim verification to assess the veracity of the claim based on the retrieved evidence.
